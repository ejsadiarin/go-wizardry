# Connections

Textio has group chats that make communicating with multiple people much more efficient--if the chat doesn't descend into chaos.

Instead of sending the message multiple times to individual people, you send one message to all of them at once.

# Assignment

Complete the countConnections function that takes an integer groupSize representing the number of people in the group chat and returns an integer representing the number of connections between them.

- For each additional person in the group, the number of new connections continues to grow.
- Use a for loop to accumulate the number of connections instead of directly using a mathematical formula.
