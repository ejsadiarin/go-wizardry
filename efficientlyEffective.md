# Fail fast, fail often
> - also known as "fail early, fail often"

I live by that principle, I don't think everyone understands or appreciates that method of problem-solving 

Just doing it brings your attention to gaps in knowledge that you can fill in much faster once you're aware they exist 

I find it far more time-efficient to fill a gap you know exists than one you assume to exist.
