# Embedded Structs

Go is not an [object-oriented](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) language. However, embedded structs provide a kind of data-only inheritance that can be useful at times. Keep in mind, Go doesn't support classes or inheritance in the complete sense, but embedded structs are a way to elevate and share fields between struct definitions.

```go
type car struct {
  make string
  model string
}

type truck struct {
  // "car" is embedded, so the definition of a
  // "truck" now also additionally contains all
  // of the fields of the car struct
  car
  bedSize int
}
```

# Embedded vs nested

- Unlike nested structs, an embedded struct's fields are accessed at the top level like normal fields.
- Like nested structs, you assign the promoted fields with the embedded struct in a [composite literal](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Composite_literals).

```go
lanesTruck := truck{
    bedSize: 10,
    car: car{
        make: "toyota",
        model: "camry",
    },
}

fmt.Println(lanesTruck.bedSize)

// embedded fields promoted to the top-level
// instead of lanesTruck.car.make
fmt.Println(lanesTruck.make)
fmt.Println(lanesTruck.model)
```

# Assignment

At Textio, a "user" struct represents an account holder, and a "sender" is just a "user" with some additional "sender" specific data.

- A "sender" is a user that has a `rateLimit` field that tells us how many messages they are allowed to send.

Fix the bug by embedding the proper struct in the other.
