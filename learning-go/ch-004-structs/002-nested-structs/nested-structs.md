# Nested structs in Go

Structs can be nested to represent more complex entities:

```go
type car struct {
    make string
    model string
    doors int
    mileage int
    frontWheel wheel
    backWheel wheel
}
```

```go
type wheel struct {
    radius int
    material string
}
```

The fields of a struct can be accessed using the dot `.` operator.

```go
myCar := car{}
myCar.frontWheel.radius = 5
```

# Assignment

Textio has a bug, we've been sending texts that are missing critical bits of information!

- Before we send text messages in Textio, we must check to make sure the required fields have non-zero values.

Notice that the `user` struct is a nested struct within the `messageToSend` struct.

Both `sender` and `recipient` are `user` struct types.

Complete the `canSendMessage` function.

- It should return `true` only if the `sender` and `recipient` fields each contain a `name` and a `number`.
- If any of the default zero values are present, return `false` instead.
