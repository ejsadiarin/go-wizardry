# Ping Pong

Many tech companies play ping pong in the office during break time.

At Mailio, we play virtual ping pong using channels.

# Assignment

Fix the bug in the `pingPong` function.

If you run the code, you will see it immediately `return`s instead of simulating a game of ping pong.

- It shouldn't `return` until the entire game of ping pong is complete.
- Why is it returning instead of executing the game of ping pong?
- Remove whatever it is that lets `pingPong` return without waiting for the game to finish.

# Tips

Look at the print statements to get an idea of how `pinger` and `ponger` should interact.
