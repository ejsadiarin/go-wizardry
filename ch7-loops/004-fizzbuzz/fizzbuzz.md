# Fizzbuzz

Go supports the standard [modulo operator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVNaZntwYPw):

```go
7 % 3 // 1
```

The AND [logical operator](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Logical_operators):

```go
true && false // false
true && true // true
```

As well as the OR operator:

```go
true || false // true
false || false // false
```

# Assignment

We're hiring engineers at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game,

- a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the `fizzbuzz` function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line, but replace multiples of 3 with the text `fizz` and multiples of 5 with `buzz`.

- Print `fizzbuzz` for multiples of 3 AND 5.

_Note: This lesson is graded based on the output of your program, so don't leave any debugging print statements in your code._
